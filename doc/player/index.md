=======

The Player method is one of the top methods. Because of this, it requires a sub-method to work.

    Note: player and Player are both valid names for this method

- [getCurrentSong](getCurrentSong.md): Gets the current playing song
- [getCurrentPlaylist](getCurrentPlaylist.md): Returns all songs in queue
